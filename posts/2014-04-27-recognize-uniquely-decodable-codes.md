title: Recognize Uniquely Decodable Codes
---

A set of strings $C$ is called a uniquely decodable code, if $C^*$ has a unique factorization over $C$. Namely, for each element $s$ in $C^*$, there exist a unique finite sequence $\{s_i\}_{i=1}^m$ of elements in $C$, such that $s_1\ldots s_m = s$. We call the strings in $C$ a code string.

{Problem}(Uniquely Decodable Code Recognition)
    
    Let $C$ be a finite set of strings, decide if $C$ is a uniquely decodable code.

In general, the infinite version of the problem is undecidable. It is however decidable if [$C$ is a regular language](http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6114/represent-string-as-concatenations).

We shall describe another formulation of [Sardinasâ€“Patterson algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinas%E2%80%93Patterson_algorithm), which combines the description of [@jewelsofstringology] and [@rodeh]. 
In the entire article, we assume the alphabet size is fixed. 
For variable sized alphabet, let $\sigma$ be the number of distinct alphabet appeared in $C$. There is an extra factor of $\sigma$ or $\log \sigma$ depending on if there exist a comparator for the alphabet.

Define $S(C) = \{ v| xv = c, c\in C\}$, the set of suffixes of $C$. $I(C) = \{ v| c'v = c, c'\neq c, c',c\in C\}$, we call those initial suffix.

{Lemma}
    
    $C$ is uniquely decodable if and only if there is no $v\in I(C)$, such that $vs\in C^*$ and $s\in C^*$. 

{Proof}
    
    If there exist such $v$ so $vs,s\in C^*$. $c'v=c$ for some $c,c'\in C$. Consider the string $cs=c'(vs)$. It has at least two factorization, one start with $c$, the other start with $c'$, and $c'\neq c$.

    Let no such $v$ exists. Consider some $u\in C^*$. It can be written as $cs$ and $c's'$ for $c,c'\in C$, $s,s'\in C^*$. Assume there is more than one factorization, then $c'\neq c$ and wlog $c'v=c$. We arrive $vs=s'\in C^*$, a contradiction.

Consider a $G=(V,A)$ a directed graph. $V=S(C)$. There is an arc from $a$ to $b$ if $ab=c$ or $cb=a$ for some $c\in C$. Namely, $a$ is either a prefix of $c$ or $c$ is a prefix of $a$.

{Theorem}

     $C$ is uniquely decodable code iff there is no a path from a vertex in $I(C)$ to $\epsilon$.

{Proof}
    
    For any arc $uv$, if $uv=c\in C$, then label the arc $uv$ by $u$. Otherwise, label the arc with $c$ where $cv = u$. It's then easy to see concatenate the labels on any walk from $v$ to $\epsilon$ spells a string of the form $vs \in C^*$ for $s \in C^*$.

    By induction, one can show that for a vertex $v$, there exist string $vs\in C^*$, where $s\in C^*$, if and only if there is a path from $v$ to $\epsilon$.

In order to compute the arcs on the graph, we need to answer two questions for every vertex $u$ and $c\in C$. Let $k=|C|$ and $n=\sum_{c\in C}|c|$.

1. Is $u$ a prefix of $c$?
2. Is $c$ a prefix of $u$?

For the first question, "Is $u$ a prefix of $c$?", we can build a a suffix tree for $C$ in $O(n)$ time.
Consider transversing the suffix tree with a code strings $c$.
Assume we have read a prefix $u$ of $c$, we can check if $u$ is actually a suffix of $C$ in constant time.
If $u$ is a suffix of $C$, then $c=uv$ where $v$ is also a suffix of $C$. It will add an arc $uv$. 
We use $O(|c|)$ time to find all the arcs can be formed by answering the "Is $u$ a prefix of $c$".
In total, we can answer question 1 in $O(n)$ time.

For the second question, "Is $c$ a prefix of $u$?", we need to check if $c$ is a prefix of $u$.
Surprisingly, the best algorithm known takes $O(nk)$ time instead of $O(n)$ time like the question above.
Fix a $c$.
We can compute the answer to all the questions involving $c$ by running $k$ string matching algorithm between $c$ with all the code strings.
Every match implies $c$ is a prefix of some suffix $u$, which implies an arc $uv$ where $cv=u$.
This takes $O(n+|c|)=O(n)$ time if we use KMP.
A total of $O(kn)$ time because there are $k$ code strings.
Instead of running $k^2$ string matchings, we can constructing a Aho-Corasick automata, and then we only have to do $k$ string matching with the automata.
In the worst case it still takes $O(nk)$ time. 

It's not clear we can construct arcs between the vertices in constant time.
The main difficulty lies in two suffix of two different code word might correspond to the same vertex in the graph.
If we number the code words, and name the suffixes by their length.
We can construct a $O(n)$ size table that maps each pair $(i,j)$ which represents the suffix of length $j$ in the $i$th string, to a vertex that represent the string, by transversing the suffix tree once. This map allow us to reach the correct vertex in constant time.

Now we have the graph with $O(nk)$ arcs.
We add a new vertex that has an arc to each initial vertices and apply a DFS from the new vertex.
If it reaches the $\epsilon$ vertex, we return true, else we return false.

{Theorem}
    There exist an algorithm to test if $C$ is a uniquely decodable code in $O(nk)$ time, where $k=|C|$ and $n=\sum_{c\in C} |c|$.
