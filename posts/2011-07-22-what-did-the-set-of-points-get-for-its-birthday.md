Q: What did the set of points get for its birthday?

A: A convex 헐! 

- 헐 sounds like "hull".
- People say "헐" when they a mildly surprised.
- A common algorithm for computing convex hulls is the [gift wrapping algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm).

I come up with this joke today, with the help of a Korean math girl. 

Hopefully computational geometers who also know Korean can appreciate that.
