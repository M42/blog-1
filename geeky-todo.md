### Todo

1. Chinese relative relation simplifier.
2. Math bin.
3. New Blog

### Think about

1. Traveling salesman... certain probability don't get the required item...


### Solved/Closed

1. Find a way to measure if two preference list are close. (related: http://mathb.in/4452 http://mathb.in/4453) The world is not such a nice place. Use the http://statistics.stanford.edu/~ckirby/techreports/NSF/EFS%20NSF%20225.pdf just use the Hausdorff metric. 
2. Hwang and Lin's merge algorithm to speedup binary search. It's was solved with a simple trick with same complexity, so this is not required. 
3. Index the order as rationals, put a new rational in between two when item inserted. Not practical, since the rational with minimum denominator could be a constant time larger than the smaller one.

### Abandoned
1. Do this in Haskell http://www.keithschwarz.com/interesting/code/?dir=extendible-array. See this too
http://twanvl.nl/blog/haskell/UnboundedArray

Demonstrate the sample with Divisors function. Abandoned because it is not interesting since all the dynamic arrays are still going to be amortized instead of worst case. (create an empty array takes O(n) time). 

2. Get chat logs from Google and do analysis. (too much work)
