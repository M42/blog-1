Here I only link to non-famous/non-research sites, so this page won't be cluttered with too many links.

### Blogs written mainly in Chinese.

- [Not "Not Even Wrong"](http://www.liuxiaochuan.org/): Xiaochuan Liu's blog. Mostly about math.

- [解构知识](http://deknowledge.com/): Duestin's blog. Mostly about philosophy.

- [4G spaces](http://blog.youxu.info/): 徐宥's blog. Mostly about computer science.

- [Geometric Delights](http://geometricdelights.wordpress.com/). Lots of geometric objects...

- [Jiawei Gao's Homepage](http://polytime.me/). Blog of Jiawei Gao, a Fudan student who likes theory.

- [Math Oh! Computer J](http://1tthinking.com/)

- [宇宙的心弦](http://www.eaglefantasy.com/)

I often refer people to read the following:

### Essays, Papers

- [What Is Mathematics For](http://www.ams.org/notices/201005/rtx100500608p.pdf): Generally, mathematics is not useful for you.

- [A Mathematician's Lament](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf): Paul Lockhart on mathematical education.

- [A Mathematician's Apology](http://www.math.ualberta.ca/mss/misc/A%20Mathematician's%20Apology.pdf): G.H. Hardy on aesthetics of mathematics.

- [How to Write a Proof](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-how-to-write.pdf): Leslie Lamport's take on structural proofs. Of course, I don't write proofs like that, but it's a interesting take.

- [Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

- [Birds and Frogs](http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200212p.pdf)

- [What books should everyone read?](http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read): for TCS.

- [What mathematical questions or areas have philosophical implications outside of mathematics?](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/6100/what-mathematical-questions-or-areas-have-philosophical-implications-outside-of-m)

- [Advanced Computer Science Courses](http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/?page_id=152)

### Other
I often need to cite interesting theorems with philosophical insights, so here will be a useful list

- Aumann's agreement theorem

- Arrow's impossibility theorem

- CAP theorem

- Gödel's incompleteness theorems

- Tarski's undefinability theorem

- Free will theorem

- Rice's theorem
