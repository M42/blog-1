title: Potential Startups
---

All start ups I want to create have at least one of the three properties.

1. It's helpful to the academia. 
2. It can make lot of money.
3. It can change how people do things.

- A sequence of cool websites one can make. List of combinatorial structures(say list of small graphs and it's properties, list of designs), list of algebraic structures(list of groups)
- [NSFW] Pandora for porn.
- Generalized Pandora for anything. 
- A mathematical/algorithmic consulting company. It also do research. One thing it can do is... given a specification of a function, we program it.
- [EVIL] Turn hatred to money. A website that take people of two different opinions, and let them fight with another in words, and other people can comment and support. 
- A company that change the way people program. For example, program by manipulate AST instead of using a text editor, advocate total functional programming.
- Local delivery infrastructure. Make same day delivery for ANY local company possible.
- Data structure and algorithm as a service. (It's like Redis, compass many more data structures).
- Combinatorially enumerate all "nice" color schemes. Or find an algorithm for generating them.
- A simple CMS for the academia(actually just math people)
- View all information as streams and one can sort and filter and respond to them... It's like generalized twitter where agents(people, programs, microwave) send data(text, video, music, code, games w/e) to recipients.
- Haskell Online Judge. A online judge that prove your code is correct instead using text files.
- A database of Chinese words so one can make 文字游戏 by programming. (cjklib does it well)
- A program read a sentence without space and automatically add space to form words.
- How can one automatically create a 3D CPU for certain tasks?
- More theorems on probabilistic logic, consider different metrics of error. 
- typing system with machine learning
- time series database. sliding window solutions to common queries. (In fact any query with certain feature)... or just write how to do it with Haskell's epic abstraction.
- Recommend people what to order in restaurants. A personalized menu that goes with everyone.
- a DSL for DP algorithms
- A way to track spending, a universal spending tracker (yes, say the companies will send you what you brought... even in supermarkets)
- when self-driving car is done, we can have fully automated taxi system.
- food tracking system
- An aboutme page that doesn't suck.
- life scheduler
- people rate people just like movies
- Replace food with pure nutrition
- Universal Analytics... Go with the time series database of course... (actually time series embedded database)
- Select text on images
- cool dashboards
- [NSFW] Replicate reddit's r/tipofmypenis. The idea is to make it automatic, where people give photos of porn stars/links to videos, and the algorithm suggest who the actor might be.  
- Pseudocode that type checks.
- A easy to use interface for maintaining a directed graph.
- so a graph relating bunch of algorithmic running times, so if one of the running time updates, it might produce other running time updates too.
