Here I present a few files that contain a list of all primitive words of length up to (k).
All the word are the smallest cyclic permutation of itself or it's reverse. 

- [abAB(18)](/files/simplewords/abAB.txt)
- [abcABC(10)](/files/simplewords/abcABC.txt)
- [abABcdCD(10)](/files/simplewords/abABcdCD.txt)
- [abABcdCDefEF(8)](/files/simplewords/abABcdCDefEF.txt)
