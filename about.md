I'm [Chao Xu](https://www.facebook.com/chao.xu), a PhD student at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) under the advisory of [Jeff Erickson](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/). I was a software engineer at Google.

I'm mainly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematics and problem solving. Algorithms, computational geometry and discrete mathematics are my favorite topics.

My undergrad was at [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu). Major in mathematics and applied mathematics. Minor in computer science.

I'm interested in summer internships in NYC.

I want to know more about:
Category theory, stringology, combinatorics on words, type theory, Haskell, programming languages, metric geometry, rewriting system, algebra, algebraic complexity theory and functional data structures.

Here is [my wife's website](http://vanessa.li).

Grand Goals in life(subjects to change):

1. Complete [this website](http://problems.site44.com/), the goal is to turn it into an Wikipedia of algorithmic problems, and find relation between the problems.

2. Create an abstract algorithms library for Haskell that handles all the common algorithmic problems. In particular this requires one to find ways to think about all the algorithms in a functional way.
