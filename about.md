I'm [Chao Xu](https://www.facebook.com/chao.xu), a PhD student at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/). Previously a software engineer at Google.

I'm mainly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematics and problem solving. Algorithms, computational geometry and discrete mathematics are my favorite topics.

I was student of [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu). Major in mathematics and applied mathematics. Minor in computer science.

Here is my [CV](/files/cv.pdf) and my [resume](/files/resume.pdf).

I seek the following opptunities, you are free to contact me about it:

- Internships where I get to use an APL style language.
- Internships where I get to use Haskell.

I want to know more about:
Category theory, stringology, combinatorics on words, type theory, Haskell, programming languages, metric geometry, rewriting system, and functional data structures. 

Here is [my girlfriend's blog](http://codesandmaze.tumblr.com/), and [her resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zwqwmnlfjw0h46i/Resume_of_Vanessa_Li_01032014.pdf). She is looking for a job right now.

Feel free to [donate some money to me](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/19986) for whatever reason.

Grand Goals in life(subjects to change):

1. Complete [this website](http://problems.site44.com/), the goal is to turn it into an wikipedia of algorithmic problems, and find relation between the problems.

2. Create an abstract algorithms library for Haskell that handles all the common algorithmic problems. In particular this requires one to find ways to think about all the algorithms in a functional way.
