I'm [Chao Xu](https://www.facebook.com/chao.xu), a PhD student at [UIUC](http://illinois.edu/) under the advisory of [Jeff Erickson](http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~jeffe/). I was a software engineer at Google.

I'm mainly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematics and problem solving. Algorithms, computational geometry and discrete mathematics are my favorite topics.

My undergrad was at [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu). Major in mathematics and applied mathematics. Minor in computer science.
