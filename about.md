I'm a software engineer at Google, working on Google Analytics.

I was student of [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu). Major in mathematics and applied mathematics. Minor in computer science. 

I'm mainly interested in theoretical computer science, mathematics and problem solving. Algorithms, computational geometry and discrete mathematics are my favorite topics.
