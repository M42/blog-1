Let $x=p/q$ be an rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are integers. There is a function $f_x$, such that $f_x(y)$ tells you if $x < y$, $x > y$ or $x=y$. What is the maximum number of queries of $f_x$ needed to find $x$?

You have a data stream of a permutation of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. However you know $k$ of the elements will be missing because the communication channel has fault. How can you detect which numbers are missing?
