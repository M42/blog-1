1. Matrix multiplication over a finite field seems as hard as matrix multiplication over reals.
 
2. If $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i/q_i=1$, $gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, then $\lcm(q_1,\ldots,q_n) \leq \max(q_1,\ldots,q_n)^{n/2}$.

3. Matrix rounding can be solved as fast as a capacitated unweighted bipartite $b$-matching. If all numbers are non-integers then it can be solved in linear time by an greedy algorithm.

1. When can we "contract" a set of points in a partial order and still remains a partial order.

1. Think about how to automatically create abbreviation. *

2. Max-flow with min number of edges is NP-hard. Garey and Johnson [ND32]

3. Generalized distributive law. Are the algorithms currently the best algorithms?
