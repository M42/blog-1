1. Matrix multiplication over a finite field seems as hard as matrix multiplication over reals.
2. If $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i/q_i=1$, $gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, then $\lcm(q_1,\ldots,q_n) \leq \max(q_1,\ldots,q_n)^{n/2}$.
3. Matrix rounding can be solved as fast as a capacitated unweighted bipartite $b$-matching. If all numbers are non-integers then it can be solved in linear time by an greedy algorithm.

1. When can we "contract" a set of points in a partial order and still remains a partial order.

1. Think about how to automatically create abbreviation. *
2. Max-flow with min number of edges is NP-hard. Garey and Johnson [ND32]
3. Generalized distributive law. Are the algorithms currently the best algorithms?

## 02/28/2014

1. Convinced there is an algorithm to solve subset sum in $O(C^\frac{5}{3}\log C)$ time.

1. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/684992/convert-curves-to-monotone-curves-without-introduce-intersections

1. Check out 4-strands braid groups. *
2. Is swapping rows of TUM still TUM? Yes.
3. Nearly TUM stuff

## 03/04/2014

1. Improved subset sum algorithm to $O((C\log C)^\frac{3}{2})$ time.
2. Element connectivity has a divide and conquer reduction approach. 

## 03/08/2014

1. Actually completed the Nearly TUM stuff.
2. Can finger tree replace [segment tree](http://letuskode.blogspot.com/2013/01/segtrees.html)? *
3. Global maximum min-cut can be found by modify Stoer-Wagner algorithm slightly.
4. For a simple graph $G=(V,E)$, $\max_{u,v \in V} \lambda(u,v) \geq 3$ then $\max_{u,v \in V}  \kappa(u,v)\geq 3$? $\lambda$ and $\kappa$ are the local edge/vertex connectivity.

1. Understood Dinic's algorithm.
2. Algebraic algorithm for string reconstruction. 
3. Understood partially, the $O(nm)$ randomized algorithm for GH Tree
4. TDI and matching.
5. Vertex Connectivity takes $O(n^4)$ time to compute, but there are algorithm that runs in $O(n^{15/4})$ time for undirected graph.

1. Complement of proper circular arc graph is a graph with circular one adjancency matrix.
2. A complete understanding of the nearly totally unimodular matrix paper by Gijswigt.

1. Randomized algorithms are hard.
