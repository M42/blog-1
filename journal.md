1. Matrix multiplication over a finite field seems as hard as matrix multiplication over reals.
2. If $\sum_{i=1}^n p_i/q_i=1$, $gcd(p_i,q_i)=1$, then $\lcm(q_1,\ldots,q_n) \leq \max(q_1,\ldots,q_n)^{n/2}$.
3. Matrix rounding can be solved as fast as a capacitated unweighted bipartite $b$-matching. If all numbers are non-integers then it can be solved in linear time by an greedy algorithm.

1. When can we "contract" a set of points in a partial order and still remains a partial order.

1. Think about how to automatically create abbreviation. *
2. Max-flow with min number of edges is NP-hard. Garey and Johnson [ND32]
3. Generalized distributive law. Are the algorithms currently the best algorithms?

1. Convinced there is an algorithm to solve subset sum in $O(C^\frac{5}{3}\log C)$ time.

1. Check out 4-strands braid groups. *
2. Is swapping rows of TUM still TUM? Yes.
3. Nearly TUM stuff *

1. Improved subset sum algorithm to $O((C\log C)^\frac{3}{2})$ time.
2. Element connectivity has a divide and conquer reduction approach.
