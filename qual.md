5. First, as $v$ moves to the right, the set of possible $h_l$ gets smaller, and $h_r$ is getting larger. The idea is we find the median of the points in the $x$ axis, and put down $v$, and test if it's possible to get $h_l$. If it is, then check if it's possible to find a $h_r$. It both possible, we are done. If only one is possible, then we can try to move $v$ to another quadrant. This would be doing a binary search, but the time complexity is at most a half each time.
As for counterexample... 5 points required I think.
